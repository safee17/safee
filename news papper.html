                    Star cricketer Hardik Pandya broke into tears moment India defeated South Africa in the T20 World Cup 2024 final match on Saturday. Following the win, industrialist Anand Mahindra, who is widely known for his inspiring videos, dedicated his #MondayMotivation to Pandya.</td>

                        Sharing an emotional picture of the all-rounder from the T20 World Cup 2024, Mahindra reminded his viewers about the brutal scrutiny Pandya faced during the Indian Premiere League (IPL) 2024. “Take a good look. This is the face of a sportsperson who was being heckled on the field and roasted on social media a very short while ago. His tears came from seeing redemption,” he wrote.

                        “Because when that picture was taken, he was a hero again. For having bowled the nerve-wracking last over in the #T20WorldCupFinal and being one of the key players in achieving India’s victory. The moral? Whenever life deals you a blow & knocks you down….You can, and will, Rise again…He’s my #MondayMotivation,” Mahindra added.
                        With over 36,000 views, the said post garnered many reactions as cricket enthusiasts hailed Pandya. Reacting to it, a user commented, “A moral worth remembering but ever so hard to live in the moment!” Another user wrote, “India owes an apology to Hardik Pandya for what he’s been through in the past few months. Despite going through all the hatred, his resilience and performance on the field have been nothing short of remarkable.”
